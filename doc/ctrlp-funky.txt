COMMANDS					*ctrlp-funky-commands*

This plugin provides a command |:CtrlPFunky|. You just execute it.

						*ctrlp-funky-:CtrlPFunky*
:CtrlPFunky [WORD]
	Abstract lines from a current editing file.
	You can provide an argument for the command. If it's provided you can
	get lines that matches the 'WORD'.
	In fact, the argument will be inputted into the CtrlP buffer by default.

Defining a mapping for this command must be useful. >
	nnoremap <Leader>fu :CtrlPFunky<Cr>
	" Initialise list by a word under cursor
	nnoremap <Leader>fU :execute 'CtrlPFunky ' . expand('<cword>')<Cr>
<


==============================================================================
SETTINGS					*ctrlp-funky-settings*
You can customise behaviour of ctrlp-funky using these variables.

					*'g:ctrlp_funky_after_jump'*
After cursor jumped to your wanted function line, what did you frequently tap
before getting into real work? '|zo|', '|zx|', '|zx||zt|', or '|zv||zz|' etc.
The valid action string consists of two part:
    The first part can be one of  '|zx|', '|zv|', '|zo|' or '|zO|' for setting fold
    view. If |foldenable| if off, then this part has no effect.  The second
    part can be one of '|zt|', '|zz|' for scrolling screen.
Both of they can be '', which means nothing will be done.
The |g:ctrlp_funky_after_jump| can be a single string:
(default: 'zxzz')
>
       let g:ctrlp_funky_after_jump = 'zxzt'
<
which affects all filetypes, or it can be a dictionary as follows:
>
       let g:ctrlp_funky_after_jump = {
            \ 'default' : 'zxzz',
            \ 'python'  : 'zO',
            \ 'cpp'     : 'zxzt',
            \ 'go'      : 'zz',
            \ 'vim'     : '',
       \ }
<
If you want to leave some 'margin' after 'z[tb]', see |scrolloff|.


					*'g:ctrlp_funky_sort_by_mru'*
If this is enabled (=1) the list is sorted by MRU (most recently used).
In short, a function definition what was used last time is appeared on top of
the list.
Note that the MRU feature doesn't work persistently. Therefore if you delete
the buffer or once you quit Vim, order of the list is reset to default.
(default: 0)
(value: 0 or 1)
>
	let g:ctrlp_funky_sort_by_mru = 1
<


					*'g:ctrlp_funky_syntax_highlight'*
If this is enabled (=1) |syntax-highlighting| feature is enabled in the CtrlP-
buffer. It just sets |filetype| to CtrlP buffer same as the current buffer.
(default: 0)
>
	let g:ctrlp_funky_syntax_highlight = 1
and the file wasn't changed the funky loads function definitions from cache,
so this makes the funky faster.
Note that the funky detects file changed by timestamp and file size.
(default: 0)
(value: 0 or 1)
>
	let g:ctrlp_funky_use_cache = 1
<

					*'g:ctrlp_funky_matchtype'*
This changes matching algorithm used inside ctrlp.vim. If you want to have
highlight matched chars feature, you may set this option to 'path'.
Note that this option changes matching algorithm, so perhaps filtered result
is affected, I guess it's not big affection though.
Also this option can be taken 'tabs' and 'tabe', however, I don't think it's
useful setting these values.
(default: 'line')
(value: 'line', 'path', 'tabs', 'tabe')
>
	let g:ctrlp_funky_matchtype = 'line'
<
					*'g:ctrlp_funky_nolim'*
This allows you to switch to no-limit mode. By default, the funky buffer is
not scrollable = limit mode.
(default: 0)
(value: 0 or 1)
>
	let g:ctrlp_funky_nolim = 1
>

[sh]					*ctrlp-funky-sh*

In most of the case, '/bin/sh' is an alias (symlink) of an other shell such as
bash, ksh etc nowadays. You can specify the Funky's internal filetype for 'sh'.
If this is set to 'dash', the Funky treats 'sh' as 'dash'.
(default: 'bash')
>
	let g:ctrlp_funky_sh_type = 'ksh'
<

FILTER IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE			*ctrlp-funky-filter-guide*
This section describes how to implement your own filter.
The internal API has been changed since |ctrlp-funky| version 0.6.0.
Therefore, if the filter uses old API you may get an error.

						*ctrlp-funky-api-v0.6.0*
						*ctrlp-funky-create-own-filter*
The filetype filter must have an |autoload| function named 'filters'.
This 'filters' function must return a |List| which contains |Dictionaries|.
And each |Dictionary| must have 'pattern' and 'formatter' as keys.
NOTE: directory structure has been changed since v0.9.1.

This is a filter for filetype 'vim'.
>
  function! ctrlp#funky#ft#vim#filters()
    let filters = [
          \ { 'pattern': '\m\C^[\t ]*function!\?[\t ]\+\S\+',
          \   'formatter': ['\m\C^[\t ]*', '', ''] }
    \ ]

    " You can highlight whatever in the ctrlp.vim window if you want
    call ctrlp#funky#highlight('^[\t ]*function[\t ]',
                             \ 'CtrlPFunkyVimFunc', 'Function')

    return filters
  endfunction
<
[Meaning of the filter's keys]
String	pattern~
  This is a regexp to extract function definitions.

List	formatter~
  |ctrlp-funky| formats each line that extracted from current buffer using
  values of this item. Actually, these items are simply assigned as arguments
  for |substitute()| function.
  A sample function above removes leading whitespaces.
